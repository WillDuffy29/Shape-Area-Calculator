# Shape-Area-Calculator
This Python program calculates the area of various geometric shapes: Square, Rectangle, Triangle, and Circle. Users can select a shape, input the relevant dimensions, and the program outputs the calculated area.

The project was built to practice user input, conditional logic, loops, and structuring interactive programs in Python.

WHAT I LEARNED

During this project, I practiced and reinforced:

- Variables and data types  
- User input handling  
- Conditional logic (if/elif/else)  
- Loops to allow repeated use of the program  
- Arithmetic operations for calculating areas  
- Structuring a program for multiple interactive options  

Technologies Used

- Python 3

HOW TO RUN

1. Install Python on your machine
2. Download the project files
3. Open a terminal in the project directory
4. Run the program

FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS

I worked with the concepts of loops which I have learned, and figured out a way to make my program run again if required by user input. Though, I'm sure having an entire program within a 'while' loop isn't very efficient. I will learn about functions, and apply one to significantly streamline my code. 

NOTES

I am learning Python with the help of a website (https://www.codedex.io/home). This code as built inspired by given prompts, but the code is my own work.
